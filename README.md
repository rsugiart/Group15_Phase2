Welcome to Group 15's Package Registry Webservice!!




## Introduction
Group 15 aims to develop a package registry for companies such as ACME to view and determine what packages to use in their software projects. Keep reading to find out how to put this repo to work!


## AWS Tech Stack


see documentation [here](docs/API_DOCS.md)




### General Overview:

#### **Compute**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda
  - **Justification**: Serverless, auto-scalable, and efficient for handling REST API calls without the need to manage backend servers.
- **Considered**: Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate

#### **Storage**
- **Selected**: Amazon DynamoDB
  - **Justification**: Scalable, low-latency NoSQL database that integrates seamlessly with Lambda for real-time data needs.
- **Considered**: Amazon RDS, Amazon S3

#### **API Management**
- **Selected**: Amazon API Gateway
  - **Justification**: Reliable for routing HTTP requests to Lambda functions; follows RESTful API patterns.
- **Considered**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)

#### **Security**
- **Selected**: AWS IAM
  - **Justification**: Provides least-privilege access, ensuring secure interactions between Lambda and DynamoDB.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Logging**
- **Selected**: Amazon CloudWatch
  - **Justification**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities for tracking performance and operational health.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Continuous Integration/Delivery**
- **Selected**: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild
  - **Justification**: Streamlines CI/CD processes, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment for consistent development and delivery.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Auto-Scaling**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda (Inherent Auto-Scaling)
  - **Justification**: Automatically adjusts the number of active instances based on incoming traffic, ensuring efficient handling of workloads.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Frontend Deployment**
- **Selected**: AWS Amplify
  - **Justification**: Seamlessly deploys and hosts frontend applications with CI/CD integration for rapid updates.
- **Considered**: Amazon S3 with CloudFront

#### **Backend Deployment**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda
  - **Justification**: Serverless backend deployment reduces the need for manual infrastructure management and integrates with other AWS services like DynamoDB and API Gateway.
- **Considered**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS ECS

## Trustworthy Module Registry: Detailed Use Case


### Actors
1. **ACME Corporation Developers**: Engineers responsible for module integration in company projects.
2. **System Administrator**: Oversees registry operations, manages user access, and monitors security.
3. **External Collaborators**: Vendors or external developers with restricted access to specific modules.


### Goal
To provide a robust, secure, and efficient module registry tailored for ACME Corporationâ€™s needs, ensuring reliable module usage, streamlined vetting processes, and secure internal storage.


---


### Primary Scenario


#### 1. Module Upload and Rating
- **Trigger**: A developer creates a new npm package to share within ACME's internal projects.
- **Action**:
  - Developer uploads the zipped package to the registry.
  - The system evaluates the package using metrics like dependency pinning and review percentages.
  - A rating score is generated and displayed.
- **Outcome**: Package is successfully uploaded and rated for quality assurance.


#### 2. Dependency and Version Management
- **Trigger**: Developer queries for specific versions of a dependency.
- **Action**:
  - Search API fetches version ranges (e.g., exact, bounded, or semantic ranges).
  - Developer selects an appropriate version for project compatibility.
- **Outcome**: Selected dependency version is added to the project.


#### 3. Efficient Search and Retrieval
- **Trigger**: A team member needs a module with specific functionality.
- **Action**:
  - Executes a search query using regex over package names and READMEs.
  - Retrieves a subset of matching modules with details.
- **Outcome**: Relevant modules are located efficiently.


#### 4. Internal Module Storage
- **Trigger**: ACME wants to store proprietary modules securely.
- **Action**:
  - Upload modules to private storage.
  - Restrict access to authorized employees or groups.
- **Outcome**: Proprietary modules are securely stored and accessed only by intended users.


#### 5. Package Ingestion
- **Trigger**: Developers request to add a public npm package.
- **Action**:
  - System validates the package against scoring metrics.
  - If acceptable, the package is ingested and added to the registry.
- **Outcome**: Public package is successfully integrated and accessible within the system.


#### 6. Cost and Impact Analysis
- **Trigger**: A manager requests an analysis of dependency size costs.
- **Action**:
  - System computes direct and transitive size costs.
  - Generates a cumulative report for multiple dependencies.
- **Outcome**: Decision-making on dependency use is supported by quantitative data.


---


### Extended Features


#### Security and Access Control
- The system executes a JavaScript monitoring program for validation.
- Role-based permissions regulate user actions (e.g., upload, search, download).


---


### Benefits
- **Streamlined Development**: Developers spend less time vetting modules manually.
- **Security Assurance**: Controlled access and monitoring reduce risks of malicious usage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale queries without performance degradation.
- **Customization**: Supports both private and public modules, catering to diverse use cases.
