Explanation of Each Folder/Files:
Backend: Handles server-side operations like managing packages, debloating, interacting with AWS S3, and fetching package versions. Services are modularized to improve maintainability.

Frontend: Implements a React-based user interface, including forms for uploading, updating, rating, and downloading packages. The frontend is styled with styles.css.

Tests:

Backend tests: Cover API and service logic, including file uploads and downloads.
Frontend tests: Unit and integration tests for components and pages using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
E2E tests: End-to-end testing of key flows like uploading and downloading packages.
Config: Stores configuration files for the database, AWS, and Jest testing.

Docs: Contains all project-related documentation, including the refined requirements, API specs, security analysis, and CI/CD plan.

Data: Contains a sample package registry file for testing and initial setup.

Logs: Keeps logs for backend operations, frontend, and deployment to track issues and performance.

Scripts: Various shell scripts to automate tasks like running tests, deploying to AWS, and resetting the registry.

Public: Contains static assets for the frontend, such as the main index.html and a favicon.

Utils: Utility functions to handle specific tasks like calculating package sizes, handling regex for search, and formatting versions.

GitHub Actions Workflows:

test.yml: Runs tests on pull requests and pushes.
build.yml: Handles the build process on pushes.
deploy.yml: Deploys to AWS S3 and invalidates CloudFront cache on successful builds.
Additional Notes:
ADA compliance: You might need to ensure that the frontend components are accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
Security: The THREAT_MODEL.md should describe security measures, focusing on ThreatModeler STRIDE analysis and risk mitigation.
